## AI Cook

### Introduction 
We have built a solution to make grocery shopping and cooking more efficient with the help of AI. The project's goal is to save time as well as assist in quality meal preparation. The user will also be able to track his/her grocery inventory and consumption trend. 


## Details of the project: 

### AI Chef UI: 

1. The user will first scan the cash memo       obtained by shopping at a grocery store. The items from the memo will be added to the inventory list as data.  

2. Next from the AI Chef option in the UI the user can input which 'Type of Cuisine', 'Type of Diet', 'Number of Portions' and 'Maximum Preparation Time' for his/her next meal.

3. Harnessing the power of AI the application will generate a dish to cook along with a list of required ingredients needed from the inventory and the process of cooking.

4. The user can either select the suggested meal or move to the next suggestion. If the user cooks a generated meal the inventory will be adjusted accordingly. 

5. The application will save the recipes that the user cooks for future reference.

6. The application will also be able to notify the user when it is time to go shopping again. It can also generate a list of grocery items that are running low in the inventory.
