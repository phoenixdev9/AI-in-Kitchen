## AIKA

### Introduction 
We have developed an AI-powered solution to streamline grocery shopping and cooking, with the aim of making meal preparation both more efficient and higher in quality. Our application allows users to track their grocery inventory and consumption trends, and offers recipe suggestions based on their preferences and needs.

## Details of the project: 

### AI Chef: 

1. The user will first scan the cash memo obtained by shopping at a grocery store.The application will extract relevant information, and the items from the memo will be automatically added to the inventory list as data.

2. Next, from the AI Chef option in the UI the user can input various parameters, including "Type of Cuisine," "Type of Diet," "Number of Portions" and "Maximum Preparation Time," to generate customized recipe suggestions.

3. The system will leverage AI-powered algorithms to analyze the user's input and generate a dish to cook. The application will also provide a list of required ingredients from the inventory and the cooking procedure.

4. The user will have the option to accept or reject the recipe suggestion. If the user selects and prepares a generated recipe, the inventory will be automatically be updated based on the amount of ingredients used. 

5. The application will save the recipes that the user cooks for future reference.

6. The application will utilize predictive analytics to track the user's grocery consumption patterns and notify the user when it is time to go shopping again. The application can also generate a list of grocery items that are running low in the inventory, allowing the user to replenish their supplies proactively.

### Key Features: 

1. Shopping list extraction: The system extracts shopping list data from the user's cash memo and adds it to the inventory list for easy tracking.

2. Redis database integration: The system stores grocery item and quantity data in a Redis database for efficient data management.

3. OpenAI API integration: The system generates recipe suggestions using the OpenAI API, which provides customized and accurate meal recommendations.

4. User feedback mechanism: The system allows users to accept or decline generated recipe suggestions to personalize the cooking experience.

5. Inventory tracking: The system keeps a record of used grocery items and updates the inventory available in real-time.

6. Automatic shopping list generation: The system generates a shopping list for the user when it is time to go shopping again based on their inventory levels.

Whether you're a student on a budget, a busy professional, or a weekend commuter, **AIKA** is the kitchen management app you never knew you needed. It's the perfect solution for anyone who wants to simplify their meal planning routine, reduce food waste, and save time and money in the kitchen.

## Key Features

### Inventory Management

- Add your grocery inventory either by taking a photo of cash memos or manually inputting your inventory.

### Recipe Generation

- Use OpenAI GPT-3 API to generate recipes based on your preferences and inventory.

### Smart Shopping Lists

- The app learns the patterns of usage and creates smart shopping lists by subtracting the ingredients that are being used in the recipes the user chooses to use.

### Favorite Recipe Storage

- Users can save their favorite recipes generated, and they get saved in a separate page with beautiful images generated from OpenAI Dall-E in a blog-style interface, so the user can get back to them whenever they want.

## Deployment

The app is currently deployed using Streamlit [here](https://lynx-kitchen-inventory-recipe.streamlit.app/).

## Technologies Used

### [Redis](https://redis.io/)

Redis is an open-source, in-memory key-value data store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker.

### [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction)

OpenAI GPT-3 API is a cloud-based artificial intelligence platform that provides access to state-of-the-art language models, including GPT-3 and LLMs.

### [OpenAI Dall-E](https://openai.com/dall-e/)

OpenAI Dall-E is a neural network-based image generation API that can generate images from textual descriptions.

## Future Improvements

- We plan to create a mobile app version of AIKA for easier access on the go.
- We plan to integrate **OpenAI Whisper** to add voice commands to the app. 

## Hackathon Details

AIKA is being developed as part of the **OpenAI Stack Hack**, organized by [Lablab.ai](Lablab.ai). You can learn more about the hackathon [here](https://lablab.ai/event/openai-hackathon).
